# Samuel Williams Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Samuel Williams, a full stack developer.

## About Me

I'm Samuel Williams, a full stack developer with a passion for games, dogs, and anime. When I'm not coding, you can often find me immersed in the virtual worlds of video games, enjoying the company of my furry friends, or exploring the imaginative realms of anime. I believe that creativity knows no bounds, whether it's in coding or in the stories told by video games and anime.

I'm enthusiastic about creating web applications and exploring the ever-evolving tech landscape. Let's connect, collaborate, and share our love for technology, games, dogs, and anime!

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on.
